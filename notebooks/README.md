## Usage

### Textual Data Analysis

The textual data analysis scripts allow you to perform a variety of analyses on financial analyst data, including:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Analyze headline lengths, count articles by publisher, and examine publication trends.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis on article headlines using sentiment analysis models.
3. **Topic Modeling**: Identify key topics from article headlines using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze the frequency of article publications over time.
5. **Publisher Analysis**: Examine contributions by publishers and domains.

To run the analysis:

```python
# Load and analyze analyst data
analyst_data = load_analyst_data()
headline_stats = headline_length_statistics(analyst_data)
publisher_counts = count_articles_by_publisher(analyst_data)
publication_trends = analyze_publication_dates(analyst_data)
sentiments = perform_sentiment_analysis(analyst_data['headline'])
lda_model, vectorizer = perform_topic_modeling(analyst_data['headline'], num_topics=5, num_top_words=10)
publication_freq = analyze_publication_frequency(analyst_data)
publisher_contributions = analyze_publisher_contributions(analyst_data)
domain_contributions = analyze_domains(analyst_data)
